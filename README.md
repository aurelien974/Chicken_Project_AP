# The Chicken Project
*This is a work for Enjmin for which we learned in a week how to make a chicken with 3ds Max, integrate it in Unity3D and make things with it, add sounds and use Adobe Premiere to make a trailer of all that.*

### If you want to edit the project, follow these instructions to configure Unity Editor (v4.3 and up) :

1. Enable External option in Unity → Preferences → Packages → Repository. (Skip this step in v4.5 and up)
2. Switch to Visible Meta Files in Edit → Project Settings → Editor → Version Control Mode.
3. Switch to Force Text in Edit → Project Settings → Editor → Asset Serialization Mode.
4. Save the scene and project from File menu.
