# The Chicken Project

*This is a work for the Enjmin for which we learned in a week how to make a chicken with 3ds Max, integrate it in Unity3D and make things with it, add sounds and use Adobe Premiere to make a trailer of all that.*

*Date : 02/2015*

### The game features :

- awesome physics to go fast and jump high
- 5 gold chicken statuettes to find and collect
- a God chicken to floodlight
- nice feedbacks of your speed
- a great camera for a 3D game

*Watch the trailer to know what it looks like ! (You can find it in the Game trailer folder)*

### If you want to edit the project, follow these instructions to configure Unity Editor (v4.3 and up) :

1. Enable External option in Unity → Preferences → Packages → Repository. (Skip this step in v4.5 and up)
2. Switch to Visible Meta Files in Edit → Project Settings → Editor → Version Control Mode.
3. Switch to Force Text in Edit → Project Settings → Editor → Asset Serialization Mode.
4. Save the scene and project from File menu.
